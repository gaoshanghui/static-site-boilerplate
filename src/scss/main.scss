/* abstract */
// The abstracts folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project.
// Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.
// The rule of thumb for this folder is that
// it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own.

/* base */
@use './base/normalize';
@use './base/typography';
@use './base/global';

/* components */
// Components can be anything, as long as they:
// 1. do one thing and one thing only;
// 2. are re-usable and re-used across the project;
// 3. are independent.
// You should avoid referencing (i.e. @import-ing) component files from other component files.
@use './components/c-button-primary';

/* Layout */
// This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site
// (header, footer, navigation, sidebarâ€¦), the grid system
// or even CSS styles for all the forms.
@use './layouts/l-header';
@use './layouts/l-footer';
@use './layouts/l-section';
@use './layouts/l-flex-two-colums';
@use './layouts/l-flex-three-colums';

/* pages */
// page-specific styles:
// Styles specific to individual pages sit here.
// You can also put them in a pages/ folder, in a file named after the page.
// For example, a _p-home.scss file in pages/.
@use './pages/p-home';

/* venders */
// the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks.
// For example, @use './venders/aos';
