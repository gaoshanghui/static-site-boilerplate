/* base */
@use './base/modern-normalize';
@use './base/typography';
@use './base/global';

/* components */
// Components can be anything, as long as they:
// 1. do one thing and one thing only;
// 2. are re-usable and re-used across the project;
// 3. are independent.
// You should avoid referencing (i.e. @import-ing) component files from other component files.
// @use './components/c-button';

/* pages */
// page-specific styles:
// Styles specific to individual pages sit here.
// You can also put them in a pages/ folder, in a file named after the page.
// For example, a _p-home.scss file in pages/.
@use './pages/p-home';

/* venders */
// the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks.
// For example: @use './venders/aos';
